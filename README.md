# RULE BASED SEGMENTATION

Hello everybody,

I have open this respository to share my rule based sementation practice. I have used a dataset which includes anonymous custormers data. I have upload the dataset which named as "persone.csv" to repo as well.

Dataset has three columns:

1. Price: The spendings which customers made
2. Source: The platforms which users use (e.g. Android, IOS etc.)
3. Sex: The genders of customers
4. Country: The abbreviation of customers countries (e.g bra for Brazil, fra for France etc.)
5. Age: The age of customers

Thanks for your interest in this project :)
